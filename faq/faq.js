        BFBB Decomp is a reverse engineering project where we are attempting to
		make a 1:1 recreation of the game's original source code. This will 
		allow us to better understand the game and make the game's code easier 
		to modify.

        "answer": `
            Yes, but there are some major caveats that limit its usefulness right now.
            The biggest caveat is that the game's code cannot be "shifted" around.
            New code can be added and existing code can be replaced as long as it isn't
            shifted around.
